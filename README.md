A collection of things I wish I knew 20 years ago


## Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey

> "Simplicity is hard work. But, there's a huge payoff. The person who has a genuinely simpler system - a system made out of genuinely simple parts, is going to be able to affect the greatest change with the least work. He's going to kick your ass. He's gonna spend more time simplifying things up front and in the long haul he's gonna wipe the plate with you because he'll have that ability to change things when you're struggling to push elephants around."

## Think Different by Dave Thomas

Imperitive object oriented is the norm. Watch this to think about programming in a more simple way. Bonus points... pickup Dave's [Elixir book](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Elixir-Functional-Concurrent-Pragmatic/dp/1937785580) and challenge yourself to think differently.

## Does organization matter? by Uncle Bob

> If the whole program is twenty lines long, and you can see all the interactions of all the variables then, yes, this is easy to read and easy to change.

> But what if that code up there was part of a ten thousand line program? What are the implications of that if statement? Will any other function be confused by the fact that the dial function changed the volume of the modem?

## The Pendulum by Bruce Tate

Learn about how application architectures come and go over the years.

> Throughout history, the needs of the consumer, hardware limitations, and the capabilities of languages have set a pendulum in motion. At one side, the pendulum dictates that user interfaces be glorified forms with simple request-response semantics. At other times, the pendulum swings to the opposite extreme, and user interfaces become rich and dynamic, but they leave the programmer to deal with increasingly high technical mountains.

## How to Stop Hating your Test Suite by Justin Searls

> Years helping teams write better tests has taught me one thing: consistency is crucial. Inconsistent tests slow teams down, wasting time to understand how each test works. Deciding on conventions—even arbitrary ones—can prevent tremendous pain later.
