## Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey

> "Simplicity is hard work. But, there's a huge payoff. The person who has a genuinely simpler system - a system made out of genuinely simple parts, is going to be able to affect the greatest change with the least work. He's going to kick your ass. He's gonna spend more time simplifying things up front and in the long haul he's gonna wipe the plate with you because he'll have that ability to change things when you're struggling to push elephants around."

## Think Different by Dave Thomas

Imperitive object oriented is the norm. Watch this to think about programming in a more simple way. Bonus points... pickup Dave's [Elixir book](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Elixir-Functional-Concurrent-Pragmatic/dp/1937785580) and challenge yourself to think differently.

## The Pendulum (of Applications) by Bruce Tate

Learn about how application architectures come and go over the years.

> Throughout history, the needs of the consumer, hardware limitations, and the capabilities of languages have set a pendulum in motion. At one side, the pendulum dictates that user interfaces be glorified forms with simple request-response semantics. At other times, the pendulum swings to the opposite extreme, and user interfaces become rich and dynamic, but they leave the programmer to deal with increasingly high technical mountains.
